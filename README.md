1. Creational Patterns
	These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, 
	rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more 
	flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
	
2. Structural Patterns
	These design patterns concern class and object composition. 
	Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
	
3. Behavioral Patterns
	These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
	
4. J2EE Patterns
	These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
